# Stellenbosch-University-Python-Workshop
# SCHOOL OF DATA SCIENCE AND COMPUTATIONAL THINKING



More data is being generated and stored than ever before. We generate data through various
processes. 
For example, we generate data when we transact at a shop, when our smart watches
record our steps, and when we record a Zoom meeting. Given the advancement in computational
power and storage, we are using these stored datasets to make sense of the world around
us and to make decisions. These decisions can help to advance business, health, sporting and
other outcomes. An important aspect of learning data science is learning to code and using code
to build data science models. This workshop introduces data science using Python. It builds
up from basic coding in Python to data science models.
